<p>Hello everyone, in this post I would like to know about the first experience of using <a href="https://github.com/Tinkoff/invest-python">tinkoff-invest API</a>.
Used it to create a terminal application that rebalanced a portfolio.</p>
<p><img alt="example" src="http://83.220.172.52:5000/img/2" /></p>
<p>Pros I found in the API:
- fairly simple structure, easy to understand
- Transparent distinction of access rights to accounts
- Ability to experiment in the sandbox
Minuses:
- Sandbox is not stable</p>
<hr />
<p>In the future, I want to try writing a trading robot using this API.
Bye everyone!</p>
